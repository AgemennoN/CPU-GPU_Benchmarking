CPU-GPU Benchmarking


This project is about, drawing a cubesphere in CPU and rotate it with matrix operations in its own center at the CPU. Then making the same rotating proccess in the GPU and comparing their performances. And if it is possible increasing the performance at the GPU with parrallelism techniques.


V1 added:

Subdivision and rotating the cube in CPU (can't do both in the same time, I don't know why. I am working on it)
same operations will be done in GPU to increase performance in V2
