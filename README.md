CPU-GPU Benchmarking


This project is about, drawing a cubesphere in CPU and rotate it with matrix operations in its own center at the CPU. Then make the same rotating proccess in the GPU and compare their performances. And if it is possible increase the performance at the GPU with parrallelism techniques.
